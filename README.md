# React Custom Component Project

The React Custom Component Project is a React application that includes a collection of custom components for building user interfaces. It features a custom router, sidebar, dropdown, accordion, buttons, modal, sortable table, and counter.

## Features

- Custom Router: A flexible and configurable router component for handling navigation within the React application.
- Sidebar: A sidebar component for creating a sidebar menu or navigation panel.
- Dropdown: A customizable dropdown component for displaying lists of options.
- Accordion: An expandable and collapsible accordion component for organizing content.
- Buttons: A set of styled buttons with various options and styles.
- Modal: A modal component for displaying overlays and dialog windows.
- Sortable Table: A table component with the ability to sort columns.
- Counter: A simple counter component for incrementing, decrementing and adding much more values.

## Dependencies

The React Custom Component Project relies on the following libraries:

- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for building responsive and customizable user interfaces.
- classnames: A JavaScript utility for conditionally joining classNames together.
- immer: A library for working with immutable state by creating the next immutable state tree based on the current state and a set of changes.
- react-icons: A collection of customizable icons for React applications.
- prop-types: A runtime type-checking library for React props.

## Usage

The React Custom Component Project is designed as a standalone application, and the custom components included in this project are tailored specifically for this application's needs. To use these components in other projects, you can copy the relevant component files and modify them according to your requirements.

Please note that the components in this project may have dependencies on other files within the project structure, such as styles or utility functions. Make sure to include all the necessary files when integrating the components into your own projects.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
